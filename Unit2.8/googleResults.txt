The bears are gonna do it again aren‚Äôt they‚Ä¶. Win the turnover battle by 3 and somehow lose the game. Literally an almost impossible stat. If you can do it in back to back weeks would be time to call for an investigation.

We are watching the two best defenses in the NFL 6-3 Bears early in the 4th. What a slugfest.

This lead is not safe. The #Bears need to find some kind of way to keep adding on.

Justin Fields was leading the NFL in TD passes with 11 when he got injured and MNF put it up as ‚Äúthe bad‚Äù. #MNF
